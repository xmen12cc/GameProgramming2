# Unity Behavior features

The following features make Unity Behavior an exceptional tool for developing sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) behaviors:

* **Pre-release package**: A new package that assists in creating custom logic for characters and objects.
* **Behavior graphs**: Functions similarly to state machines, enabling users to compose behavior and decision-making units within a clear readable graph.
* **Node-based flow graphs**: At runtime, you can debug behaviors presented as node-based flow graphs, enabling you to understand AI behavior by reading them from top to bottom.
* **Human-readable nodes**: The design of nodes aims to facilitate understanding, enabling the creation of representations that read like narratives.
