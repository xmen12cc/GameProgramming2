## Register for generative AI

You must register for the Unity Behavior subscription to use the generative artificial intelligence (AI) features.

1. Sign up with your email on the [Unity Product and Solutions](https://create.unity.com/ai-sign-up) website and select **Unity Behavior (Pre-release)** as a product of interest.

2. You will receive an email notifying you of your invitation to Unity Behavior. After accepting the invitation, you will have access to the generative AI features.

You can now use the generative AI feature of Unity Behavior to generate an [entire behavior graph or a branch](gen-ai-behavior-graph.md) of an existing behavior graph. Additionally, you can use generative AI to create an [action nodes](gen-ai-node.md) for a behavior graph.
