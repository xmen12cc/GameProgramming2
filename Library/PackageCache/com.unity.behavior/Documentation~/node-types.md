# Behavior graph node types

The logic flow of the behavior graph begins at the start node at the top. You can then add further nodes to develop and expand your behavior graph.

The tables in this section provide information on the different types of nodes available in Unity Behavior along with their description.

## Action node types

To use the **Action** nodes, select **Add** > **Action**.

| Node | Description |

| **Navigation** | To use the **Navigation** options, select **Add** > **Action** > **Navigation**. |
| Navigate To Location | Navigates a GameObject to a specified position using `NavMeshAgent`. Note that if `NavMeshAgent` isn't available, the node uses `Transform`.|
| Navigate To Target | Navigates a GameObject towards another GameObject using `NavMeshAgent`. Note that if `NavMeshAgent` isn't available, the node uses `Transform`. |
| Patrol | Moves a GameObject along way points using `NavMeshAgent`. Note that if `NavMeshAgent` isn't available, the node uses `Transform`. |
| **Physics** | To use the **Physics** options, select **Add** > **Action** > **Physics**. |
| Add Force | Applies physics force to the target Rigidbody. |
| Add Torque | Applies torque to the target Rigidbody. |
| Check Collisions In Radius | Checks for collisions in a specified radius around the agent. If a collision is found, the collided object is stored in `[CollidedObject]`. |
| Set Velocity | Sets the linear velocity of the target Rigidbody to a specific value. |
| Wait For Collision | Waits for an `OnCollision` event on the specified agent. |
| Wait For Collision 2D | Waits for a 2D `OnCollision` event on the specified agent. |
| Wait For Trigger | Waits for an `OnTrigger` event on the specified agent. |
| Wait for Trigger 2D | Waits for a 2D `OnTrigger` event on the specified agent. |
| **Resource** | To use the **Resource** options, select **Add** > **Action** > **Resource**. |
| Play Audio | Plays an AudioResource at the target location. |
| Play Particle System | Plays a ParticleSystem at the target location. |
| **Scene** | To use the **Scene** options, select **Add** > **Action** > **Scene**. |
| Load Scene | Loads a Unity scene. |
| Unload Scene | Unloads a Unity scene. |
| **Transform** | To use the **Transform** options, select **Add** > **Action** > **Transform**. |
| Look At | Rotates the transform to look at the target. |
| Rotate | Rotates the transform by an Euler rotation.  |
| Scale | Scales the transform by a value. |
| Set Position | Sets the target's position to a specific location. |
| Set Position To Target | Sets the transform's position to a specific target position. |
| Set Rotation | Sets the transform's rotation to a specific Euler rotation. |
| Set Scale | Sets the transform's scale to a specific value. |
| Translate | Translates the target's position by a specific amount. |

## Events node types

| Node | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Start On Event Message | Starts the subgraph after receiving an event message.<br>You can change how the node responds to events using different modes:<br> * `Default`: Triggers the node only when it's idle and no child node is running.<br> * `Restart`: Ends all children nodes and then restarts the node.<br> * `Once`: Triggers the node only once and stops to listen to the event channel. |
| On Start | This is the root of the behavior graph. You can use multiple **On Start** nodes in your graph.|
| Send Event Message | Sends an event message on the assigned channel. |
| Wait for Event Message | Use this node when you want the game character to wait to receive an event message on the assigned channel. |

## Flow node types

| Node | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Create new Modifier | Creates a new modifier.<br> To use this node, select **Add** > **Flow** > **Create new Modifier**.<br>Modifiers affect how their connected subgraphs are run. <br>For example, a repeat modifier causes its branch to perform its operation more than once. For more information, refer to [Create a custom node](create-custom-node.md).|
| Create new Sequencing | Use this node to create a new sequencing node. To use this node, select **Add** > **Flow** > **Create New Sequencing**.<br>Sequencing nodes control how their connected branches flow. They control how sequences run and define the conditions for a sequence's completion. For more information, refer to [Create a custom node](create-custom-node.md). |
| **Abort** | To use the **Conditional** options, select **Add** > **Flow** > **Abort**. |
| Abort | Aborts the branch when the assigned conditions are true. |
| Restart | Restarts the branch when the assigned conditions are true. |
| **Conditional** | To use the **Conditional** options, select **Add** > **Flow** > **Conditional**. |
| Conditional Branch | Selects a branch based on whether the condition evaluates to true or false. |
| Switch | Branches off based on the `Enumeration` value. |
| **Parallel Execution** | To use the **Parallel Execution** options, select **Add** > **Flow** > **Parallel Execution**. |
| Run In Parallel | Runs all the branches simultaneously. You can set different execution modes in this node to handle parallel branches. |
| Wait For All | Activates a child when all parents have started this node. It can't restart until the child's subgraph has ended. |
| Wait For Any | Activates a child when any parent starts this node. It can't restart until the child's subgraph has ended. |
| **Cooldown** | Imposes a mandatory wait time between iterations to regulate action frequency. |
| **Inverter** | Inverts the result of the child action. A value of success becomes failure and a value of failure becomes success. |
| **Random** | Runs a random branch. |
| **Repeat** | Repeats the operation of a node. You can set different execution modes that define how and when the repeated task executes.|
| **Sequence** | Runs branches in order until one fails or all succeed. |
| **Succeeder** | Forces success for the child node. These nodes are useful in cases where you want to process a branch of a tree where a failure is expected or anticipated, without interrupting the processing of the sequence to which that branch belongs. |
| **Time Out** | Terminates the execution of its branch after a specified number of seconds. |
| **Try In Order** | Runs branches in order until one succeeds. |

## Subgraphs node types

| Node | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Run Subgraph | Runs the assigned subgraph and return the graph's final status. |

## Sticky note

Use the **Sticky Note** node to add a sticky note to the behavior graph. To add a **Sticky Note** to your behavior graph, follow these steps:

1. Right-click an empty area of the Unity Behavior graph editor.
2. Click **Add** from the context menu.
3. Select **Sticky Note**.

This adds a **Sticky Note** to your behavior graph, allowing you to annotate it as needed.
